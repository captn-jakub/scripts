# Contents

## Custom Scripts

Scripts using standard characters. Scripts built around a specific homebrew character should be placed in that characters homebrew directory.

### A Few Good Men

[v0.1 by capt'n jakub](custom/A_Few_Good_Men.json)

Solo Legion script, to see if it would work.

Should never give all Legion bluffs - it's fine to be outed Legion anyway.

### Delegation of Duties

[v0.1 by capt'n jakub](custom/Delegation_of_Duties.json)

"Weaker" Demons: either not choosing kills (Lil' Monsta, Yagababble, sometimes Ojo), or with a possibility of no death (Pukka with an execution on their poison).

Minions either kill or add a win condition.

Town adding evils and night deaths.

### Don't Take My Word For It

[v0.1 by capt'n jakub](custom/Dont_Take_My_Word_For_It.json)

All characters have a way of mechanical confirmation for themselves, with a few that confirm other players.

Hard mode for the evil team.

Boffin adds the possibility that the Demon confirms themselves too.

Psychopath to boost the evil's changes a bit.

Ojo has the best info it can ever get, as all town is always confirmed.

### Miss-a-Line

[v0.3 by capt'n jakub](custom/Miss-a-Line.json)

Solo Lord of Typhon, to see if it works.

Work in progress.

### Stuff Happens

[v0.1 by capt'n jakub](custom/Stuff_Happens.json)

All weirdness you can get: Amnesiac, Wizard, Magician, all kinds of dorizon, nobody knows what is going on.

Stuff just happens.

## Homebrew

[v0.2 by capt'n jakub](homebrew/the-dude-abides/the_dude_abides.json)
